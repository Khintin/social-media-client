## Workflow
### Course Assignment

This course assignment is about learning WORKFLOW. We learn how to communicate or working other project using github, Installing and Testing through terminal, testing using cypress and fixing or reporting bugs.

During this lecture its a big challenge and struggle to learn all this, specially you working on the other project. Looking for bugs, learning git using command tags and testing if all works smoothly.
We learn a lot how we figure out things on our own and the process step by step is challenging.
